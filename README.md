## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for server-side rendering
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend JavaScript library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database for storing suggestions and votes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### User Management
The application uses Firebase Authentication as the single source of truth for user data:

- **User Authentication**: Firebase Authentication handles user sign-up, sign-in, and session management
- **User Profiles**: User display names are stored and managed exclusively within Firebase Authentication
- **Server-Side Integration**: Firebase Admin SDK is used on the server to retrieve user display names when needed

This architecture simplifies user management by eliminating dual storage of user profile data.
